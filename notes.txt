# calculator

~~~~~~~~~~~Tasks~~~~~~~~~
1. Understand the Problem 
    - reword it if needed
2. Plan 
    - answer general questions 
    --does program have user interface?
    --whatwill it look like?
    --What inputs will it have? Will user enter datata or will you get input from somewhere else?
    --What is the desired output
    --Given the inputs, what steps are neccessary to return desired output
3. Psudocode 
    - write out code in natural language that will solve the last question from before
4. Divide and conquer
    - identify subproblems from the big problem, dont go after big problem from the start. Break it down and start with the smallest problems and work your way up
   

    --------------------------------------------------

    1. Problem: 
      - create an application that perfoms the following functions:
        -- a. add
        -- b. subtract
        -- c. multiply
        -- d. divide
      - will need to make an 'operate' function that takes two or more numbers, then calls one of the above funtions
      

    2. Plan
        --will have a Calculator designed interface. 
        --Will need to make functions to display and stor inputed values
        --users should be able to sting together multiple operations to get the correct answer
        --should not evaluate more than one pair of numbers at a time
    
    3. Psudocode
    
       
    
    4. Subproblems
    - need to create user interface
    - interface needs to populate and display selected numbers and oporators
    - selected numbers and operators need to be stored in variables 
    - the '=' will need to prompt the 'oporate' function to oporate the selecter math function with the stoared number variables
